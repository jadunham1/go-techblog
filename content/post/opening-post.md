I generally don't write a whole lot now, but I always aspire to write more and share my thoughts.
My interests are anything technology, beer, books, and running.  I hope that you enjoy
the posts as they come.  I am attempting to get more into the open source community
as the companies I have been at have been huge users of open source, but historically
not great contributors.
