Coming into the book I knew nothing about it, which was good.  Often times
when I read a book after my significant other I know a decent amount about the
book and don't enjoy it as much.  What a ride!  I consider myself a slow reader
as I read every word, never skimming!  And I was able to finish the book in ~5
days.

For video game enthusiasts the author paints a really good setting.  A world
that is extremely possible with many activities like work, school, and play
happening inside of virtual reality.  That and the numerous 80s pop culture
references made this book perfect for anyone born in the late 70s through the
80s.  The setting and world building was definitely the strongest point of the
book.

Immediately after finishing the book I've had a huge kick to watch some of
the 80s references I had never seen.  "War Games" held up extremely well, and
the Back to the Future triology was still extremely entertaining.

I haven't yet watched the movie, but plan on settling into it soon.  I've heard
some pretty mixed reviews.  Similar to most book adaptations, people who have
read the book in my friend group didn't enjoy the movie as some plot had
changes.  However for me the actual plot of the book was just ok, I was more
interested in the world of the OASIS, and the limitation of the avatas within
it.

I wouldn't re-read this book, but would give it a solid 8/10.
